Design Choices for the Landing Page

1. HTML Structure:
   - The page is divided into three main sections: a header, a products section, and a footer. This structure ensures a clear and intuitive navigation flow.
   - The use of the `<section>` tag for organizing content improves semantic value and accessibility.

2. Header:
   - A responsive navigation menu was implemented using Bootstrap. It features links to key sections of the page, enabling quick navigation.
   - The menu is mobile-friendly with a collapsible feature that adapts to smaller screens.

3. Hero Section:
   - A visually engaging hero section was created using a background image with overlay text and a call-to-action button. This immediately grabs the visitor's attention upon landing.

4. Product Section:
   - Product cards were designed uniformly with an image, title, description, and button, ensuring a consistent and appealing presentation.
   - Cards are styled with shadows and rounded corners to give them a modern and professional look.

5. Contact Form:
   - A simple, centered contact form allows visitors to easily get in touch with the shop. The clean design and centered layout enhance user experience.

6. Footer:
   - The footer includes copyright text and social media icons styled with Font Awesome, adding a modern visual touch and enabling easy access to social platforms.

7. Custom CSS Styling:
   - Custom styles were added to enhance the overall look of the page, focusing on the hero section, product cards, and typography.
   - Proper spacing and typography ensure a pleasant reading experience.

8. Responsive Design:
   - Media queries were used to adjust font sizes and margins, ensuring an optimal layout for smaller screens.
   - Bootstrap's flexible grid system makes the product section and form responsive across all device sizes.

9. Library Integration:
   - Bootstrap was selected for its simplicity and pre-built components, speeding up the development process.
   - Font Awesome was used for social media icons, providing a quick and elegant solution.

These design decisions were made to provide an intuitive, visually appealing, and fully responsive user experience.
